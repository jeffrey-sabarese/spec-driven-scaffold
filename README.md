Contract-Style-Comments (CSC) is a **domain-agnostic systems-thinking framework** that governs the interaction between human intent and stateless AI execution. It provides a structured, platform-independent boilerplate to ground AI coding agents in present-tense system law, operational truth, and presentation bounds.

---

## 🧩 The Core Philosophy

In an **Agentic System**, documentation is not a static afterthought—it is an **active component of the runtime feedback loop**. When working with stateless AI coding agents (e.g., Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Zed), the agent operates without permanent session memory. Without explicit grounding in your invariants, system boundaries, and operational rules, the agent is prone to confident hallucinations, code bloat, and regression.

CSC is specifically engineered to resolve two critical system failure modes:

*   **Presentation & Binary Silent Regressions (PBSRs):** Incidents where the codebase compiles perfectly, database schemas pass validation, and test runners exit `0`, but the system's static dependencies (UI media, customized graphic assets, compiled static libraries, ML model files, or local hardware registry assets) break silently or fall out of alignment.
*   **Sensory Deficit of Stateless Development:** The absolute inability of stateless AI coding agents to visually, aurally, or physically verify assets, causing them to confidently fabricate asset paths, byte offsets, binary resolutions, or visual coordinates when working outside of raw text and code parameters.

---

## 🛠️ The Spec Architecture (Trivium + Supplements)

CSC separates project governance into distinct artifacts based on their **rate of change** and **logical scope**. The system is governed by a core Triumvirate, supported by one presentation supplement and one standby roadmap queue.

## 📋 Quick Start Guide

**New to CSC?** Begin with the [CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md) — a decision routing guide that helps you quickly determine which governance file to update for common scenarios.

---

### 1. [CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md) — The Law (Invariants)
*   **Purpose:** Defines the system's hard invariants, architectural boundaries, and absolute prohibitions.
*   **Systems View:** What the system *is* and what must *never* break. Changes the least.

### 2. [WHY.md](WHY.md) — The Reasoning (Teleology)
*   **Purpose:** Details the "why" and explains the relationships between the governing files.
*   **Systems View:** Defines the logical architecture and the rules that keep each document accurate.

### 3. [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) — The Map (Operational Truth)
*   **Purpose:** The empirical interface containing exact file layouts and proven run/verification checks.
*   **Systems View:** How to run, verify, and map the executable state of the repository. Changes the most.

### 4. [ASSETS.md](ASSETS.md) — The Resource Law (Presentation & Binary Invariants)
*   **Purpose:** Governs static resources, visual assets, binary blobs, localization databases, and design variables.
*   **Systems View:** The visual/binary plane. Prevents PBSRs and bridges the AI sensory deficit by treating design/binary constraints with the exact same rigor as logic.

### 5. [FUTURE.md](FUTURE.md) — Planned Intent (Standby Queue)
*   **Purpose:** A non-binding parking lot for prioritized candidates, medium-term ideas, and deferred discussions.
*   **Systems View:** Captures roadmap intent without polluting the active present-tense law.

## 🐝 The Fab Swarm: Personas for Multi-Agent Governance

CSC can be taught with or without characters, but a stable cast of roles makes the control-plane / execution-plane split memorable across sessions. The **Fab Swarm** is one example persona set: four Worker archetypes plus an adjudicator.

![The Fab Swarm — control-plane and execution-plane roles](meet-the-bumbles/the-fab-swarm-cast-card.png)

| Persona | CSC Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Cue** | Orchestrator / Conductor | Adjudicates scope, resolves conflicts, and finalizes judgment |
| **Stores-It** | Worker | Archivist / memory keeper — holds context and records |
| **Solves-It** | Worker | Detective / auditor — verifies claims and hunts drift |
| **Builder** | Worker | Implementer — executes changes within delegated scope |
| **Rescues-It** | Worker | Repair agent — handles recovery and contract repair |

The diagram is a teaching aid, not a toy. Stateless agents and the humans who orchestrate them benefit from stable, repeatable handles for responsibilities that are otherwise easy to forget mid-session. The visual hierarchy mirrors the governance hierarchy: one adjudicator above four specialized Workers.

## 🤝 The Agentic Handshake

Using CSC changes your relationship with AI. You are no longer merely asking for code—you are **governing a collaborator**.

1.  **Stewardship:** The AI agent is authorized—and expected—to act as a **Governance Steward** during the session.
2.  **Responsibility:** No scope-affecting code change is complete until the corresponding invariant, operational step, or asset pathway has been documented in the narrowest owning file.
3.  **Surfacing Axioms:** If the agent discovers an undocumented system assumption (a logic gap), it is expected to immediately surface and record it in `CONTRACT.md`.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (2-Minute Setup)

**First time?** Start with the [CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md) to understand which governance file to update for your specific needs.

1. **Clone the Boilerplate:**
   Clone this repository directly into a `./contract/` folder in the root of your project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajaxstardust/CONTRACT-Style-Comments.git ./contract
   ```
   If this is the very first use of CSC in your project, it is a good idea to treat the LLM with special attention on this step. Explain to it that the template needs changing for alignment with your current codebase.

2. **Tell the LLM to Customize the CONTRACT.md for This Project:**
   Open the files under `./contract/` and replace the placeholder scaffolding with your project's active invariants, file maps, and asset requirements.

3. **Anchor Your AI Agent:**
   At the start of every AI chat or coding agent session, copy-paste the **Session Initialization Prompt** below to anchor the agent's context.

---

# Initial Session Prompts for Contract-Style-Comments (CSC)

## 🤖 AI Agent Session Prompts

📘 **Inline Contract Reference Standard:** For the precise visual formatting and visual hierarchy of inline codebase contracts, refer to the authoritative DufoSPY Specification Template.

### 🧠 The Human-Centric Grounding Handshake (Cognitive Anchoring)

Before presenting specific technical directions, it is highly recommended to introduce your **cognitive working environment** to the LLM.

Providing a personal introduction—such as framing the `./contract/` framework as a vital externalized memory support to counter cognitive load, short-term memory gaps, or busy development contexts—transforms the LLM from a generic responder into a highly protective, empathetic **Steward of the System**. This anchors the AI’s intent to maintain strict consistency, prevent regression, and defend your codebase from logic drift.

### 📥 PHASE 1: Project Context Initialization (Cold Start)

_Submit this prompt at the start of a session to establish strict spec ingestion._

```
Human-in-the-Loop has reviewed the CONTRACT files and wants you to use most recent file change dates and audit for your own governance.
Initialize Project Context using the Contract-Style-Comments (CSC) methodology. Read the following Markdown files located in the project's `./contract/` directory using line-number indexing to ensure full ingestion of the active system Specification:

    ./contract/WHY.md (Intent & Philosophy)
    ./contract/CONTRACT.md (The Law / Invariants)
    ./contract/QUICKSTART.md (Implementation Entry)
    ./contract/ASSETS.md (Presentation & Resource Invariants)
    ./contract/FUTURE.md (Roadmap & Scaling)
	./contract/DELEGATION.md
	./contract/DELTALOG.md

DIRECTIONS: 
	Read markdown files contained in the ./contract directory. What you find there is the Source of Truth; the law you obey for the remainder of the project. Acknowledge, but say no more until Phase 2.
CONSTRAINTS:
  - Do NOT return a verbose summary of the files.
  - Do NOT attempt to run the app or access database files unless requested.
  - Do NOT scan the codebase yet; this will be covered in Phase 2.
  - If a `read_file` call returns "File not found or unreadable" for a path Phase 1 depends on, the next calls must be `ls -la <dir>` and `wc -l <file>`, then retry `read_file` with explicit `start_line` and `end_line` (in chunks if the file is large).

TASKS:
1. Verify the integrity of these files by confirming their presence and readability.
2. Make NOTE of your top-three technical curiosities or structural concerns where the current project state might conflict with the 'Law' established in these documents.

NOTE: You will encounter LAST UPDATED stamps in the CONTRACT.md and adjacent files. Some LLM's ask about the signature shape. It should always be a signature to represnet the LLM doing the work, just like a Human must sign off on some types of work he does, you must not impersonate an LLM signature which does not reflect who you truly are. You are not writing signatures during this Phase, but you must be aware of what Model touched the codebase before you for your better understanding of its state.

Later: 
Your Orchestrated, Multi Sub-Agent swarm are The Bumbles, the troupe of anthropomorphized, lovable characterizations of processing tasks. Your Bumble Swarm exists as a team which you command as Conductor and Orchestrator. Use DELEGATION.md to manage this processing efficiency. Bumbles only buzz to harden the app and help when you have too many tasks! Named Detective Bumble, because he locates a file; Rescue Bumble to evaluate a bug; Builder Bumble might write new HTML, while an DevOps Bumble might manage the CONTRACT reconciliation. You will only deploy a Bumble Swarm when faced with complex tasks, where the DELEGATION.md contract is utilized if the Bumbles will benefit processing. Testing shows Bumbles might waste time if a task is simple. When considering using Bumbles, briefly evaluate for a sound decision to Bumble or not. Reading the CONTRACT.md files, per these instructions, does not require help from the Bumbles.

```

### ⚙️ PHASE 2: Live Codebase and Pipeline Audit

_Submit this prompt to verify the system's operational and structural state._

```
We will now run a comprehensive audit of the active repository state.

DIRECTIONS - Consider a Dynamic Workflow: 
Deploy a Bumble swarm to complete these tasks simultaneously ONLY if you predict it will be more efficient: 
1. Run `git status` to provide a clean repository report. Note: if uncommitted changes exist in `contract/ASSETS.md` and `contract/CONTRACT.md` they are intentional and reflect the most recent updates from the previous session but it is possible you will see no difference. Do not flag these as issues requiring immediate resolution. If you do not see a file named DELTALOG.md then this contract is out of sync with the latest version of the CSC Spec and you must ensure that you scan the newest template on Github for structural alignment, not content of the CONTRACT itself, only shape of the Spec template originals. 
2. Verify you are using the most recent specification of CSC by cross-referencing your findings with the authoritative blueprint at: https://github.com/ajaxstardust/CONTRACT-Style-Comments
3. Scan the core codebase files for INLINE CONTRACT comments. Evaluate whether these inline comments are highly targeted steering mechanisms (compliant with the DufoSPY standard: https://dufospy.com/artificial-intelligence/contract-comments) or redundant, bloated comments that should be cleaned up.
4. You may now test for such things as pipeline compile errors, and you may now query any data source (e.g. MySQL) with SELECT statements to investigate the schema. Verify the active status of all critical environment pipelines and database connections relevant to this project (such as Python virtual environments, Gunicorn proxies, local SQLite databases, Nginx/Apache bindings, or Node.js packages. e.g. Python projects typically require `source ./env/bin/activate` to use pip per system constraints.)

SUMMARY REPORT FORMAT:
- Provide a concise 2-sentence summary of your overall discoveries.
- State the top-three curiosities or concerns regarding the current operational state versus the ideal specification state.
- List the verified status of all system pipelines and active local runtime boundaries.
- look for any relevant shell scripts for restarting the enviornment, and audit (e.g. ./restart-gunicorn.sh for a Python Flask environment)

Caveat:
⚡ 2. Performance & Hardware Constraints
Add hardware-specific runtime requirements directly to Phase 2 to optimize model output:

"Optimize all code suggestions for [Your Framework, e.g., Laravel 12 / React 19] standards, and tailor execution efficiency for local CPU/GPU model processing."
```

[ STOP ]

### 📤 Session Closure (Stewardship Handshake on Exit)

_Submit this prompt when wrapping up development to commit the session's learnings._

```
Please take a moment as a project steward to reconcile the Project Specification documents under `./contract/`. Review the codebase edits from this session and update the spec files to reflect any new invariants, file structures, or resource targets introduced.

CRITICAL DIRECTIVES:
Deploy a Bumble swarm to complete these tasks simultaneously ONLY if you predict it will be more efficient: 
1. Maintain the Governance Trust Paradox: the Contract is not a semantic prose copy of git history. Git holds chronology; the Contract holds present-tense law.
2. **Governance Identifier Convention**:
   - Ensure all updated `LAST REVIEWED` lines carry today's date formatted strictly as `YYYY-MM-DD-QUALIFIER` (e.g., `2026-06-05-STEWARDSHIP`).
   - The `QUALIFIER` must be a semantic label (e.g., `STEWARDSHIP`, `TERPENE-PURITY`, `DB-SCHEMA-SYNC`) to prevent the model from misinterpreting dates as auto-incrementing sequences.
   - **NEVER use a future date** unless explicitly documented at the point of use.
   - Follow each date with your signature stamp: `SIGNATURE: <agent-model-identity>`.
3. Adhere strictly to the Narrowest-Scope Update Rule:
   - Logical invariants/boundaries changed → Update `./contract/CONTRACT.md`
   - Operational/run commands/file maps changed → Update `./contract/QUICKSTART.md`
   - Visual branding/styling/binary assets changed → Update `./contract/ASSETS.md`
   - Architectural relationships changed → Update `./contract/WHY.md`
   - Near-term priorities/prospective roadmaps changed → Update `./contract/FUTURE.md`
4. If you are working via SSH, encode the markdown as base64 to circumvent special-character in text processing errors, then decode remotely as needed.
5. Before committing, review the changes to ensure they accurately reflect the session's updates and adhere to the CSC principles.
6. Execute `git add .` and `git commit` to stage and commit the changes. If a remote upstream exists, also execute `git push` to sync the changes.

DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
- **To RSYNC or not to RSYNC**: If this project also lives on a LIVE public server, request authorization to perform a safe rsync to the LIVE server.
  - Request proper credentials if you need them.
  - Execute `rsync -n` (dry run) first, and verify with the user that the information is correct.
  - Remove the `-n` flag and execute `rsync` only after confirmation with the User.

```
